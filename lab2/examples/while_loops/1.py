#With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
#Print i as long as i is less than 6:
#remember to increment i, or else the loop will continue forever.
#The while loop requires relevant variables to be ready, in this example we need to define an indexing variable, i, which we set to 1.
